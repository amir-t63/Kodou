Kodou is a small package for engraving music written in Python 3.5.3. It was originally inspired by [a tutorial by Bernd Klein](https://www.python-course.eu/python_scores.php) on creating musical scores using Python.

Kodou is under active development. Feel free to report bugs, instabilities or feature wishes.
